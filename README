The image viewer is designed to be lightweight, but is has some old unresolved bugs.

Now it's time for a rewrite!

 - Port image viewing part to use GtkImageView library.
This is a nice library designed specifically for building image viewers.
It's fast and memory efficient and did a much better work than ours.

 - Use GtkUIManager to create toolbars and menus.

 - Load image files with gio so remote files can be loaded as well.

 - Load images with multi-threading to prevent blocking of UI.

 - Optional supports for preloading previous and next images in the folder.

 - List image files in folder with GIO rather than GDir to support Remote filesystems. Again, this should use
 multi-threading.

 - While the directory is still being loaded, the user should be able to navigate through the list of files that are
 already found without blocking of UI.

 - Add ability to select a region of the image and crop to it.

 - Support printing with Gtk+ printing APIs

 - Able to call external programs to open the image file. (Use GAppInfo in glib/gio)

 - Able to show EXIF information properly. (In a user friendly way)

 - Add a properties dialog showing detailed info of current image. (EXIF, size, mtime, ...etc.)

 - Add support for slide show.

 - Optimize for comic reading if a comic book is detected.

 - File alteration monitoring: update the display if the file on disk gets changed.

 - Thumbnail support, can optionally have a bar containing a list of thumbnails for easy navigation.

 - Add screenshot taking ability to GPicView. (gpicview --screenshot)

 - A prompt dialog to let the users select some capture options:
   -Full screen
   -Single window
   -Selected region
   -Including mouse cursor
   -Time delay (in seconds)
